# Projct stack details
All the projects above were created separately for better maintenance. All the client sites were created with React JS and tailwind CSS, and the server sites were created with Node JS. As for the database, Postgresql was used.  

## Benefits
During building these projects I learned a lot. It was a good experience for my growth. I learned how to make a dynamic chart for different data and how to manipulate data easily by using REST API with Postgresql.  

## Challenges
When I was working with the chart I faced great difficulty. I was facing problems filtering unique trade_code to show only related data in the chart and making them dynamic with dropdowns. After all the difficulties I eventually overcame them.
